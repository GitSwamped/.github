# 🐊 GitSwamped

**A repeatable Git/GitHub sandbox for student teams to learn by doing.**  
Templates, tutorials, and “hatchling → gator” exercises that build good habits from day one.

---

## Start here

- **Core guide & templates:** https://github.com/GitSwamped/GitSwamped  
- **Sandbox / pods (practice repo):** https://github.com/GitSwamped/GitSwamped-Pilot  
- **2FA setup (secure, no SMS):** `docs/SECURE_2FA.md` in the core repo

---

## What’s inside

- **Clean Git workflow:** branches → commits → PRs → reviews → merge to `main`  
- **Student sandbox:** each student gets a safe folder; guardrails prevent accidental edits elsewhere  
- **Instructor tooling:** roster seeding, CODEOWNERS, branch protection, CI hooks  
- **Integrations:** GitHub Actions/CircleCI examples, Jira Smart Commits

---

## For instructors

- Create a new org repo from the template.  
- Add your class roster (GitHub usernames) to `.roster.csv` → folders auto‑create.  
- Require PRs to `main` and one approval (self‑review OK in sandbox).

## For students

- Clone the sandbox, create a branch, and add a file to `hatchlings/<your-username>/`.  
- Open a PR; learn reviews, comments, and (later) 3rd party links.  
- Level up by creating your own repo/template.
